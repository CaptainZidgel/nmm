This is Nine Men's Morris.

Nothing unique or original. Just created as an exercise.

In progress.

I'm not 100% familiar with the rules of Nine Men's Morris, so please mind any inconsistencies.


aw shoot i should probably mention this is written in the https://love2d.org/ Framework.

If for some bizarre reason you wanted to compile this, download LOVE2d 11.2 and then drag the NMM folder onto the LOVE2d exe.
